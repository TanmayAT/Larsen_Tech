# Construction Equipment Monitoring AI Model

## Overview

This project aims to develop an AI-based model for monitoring construction equipment/assets utilization, productivity, and maintenance at construction sites. The model utilizes machine learning algorithms to analyze data collected from various sensors installed on construction equipment and assets.

## Features

1. **Utilization Monitoring**: The AI model tracks the usage of construction equipment/assets to ensure optimal utilization and identify any idle or underutilized resources.

2. **Productivity Analysis**: It analyzes data to measure the productivity of construction equipment, identifying factors affecting efficiency and providing insights for improvement.

3. **Maintenance Prediction**: By analyzing sensor data and historical maintenance records, the model predicts potential maintenance issues before they occur, allowing for proactive maintenance scheduling and minimizing downtime.

4. **Anomaly Detection**: The model employs anomaly detection techniques to identify abnormal behavior or performance deviations in construction equipment, alerting site managers to potential issues.

5. **Performance Dashboard**: Provides a user-friendly dashboard to visualize equipment utilization, productivity metrics, maintenance schedules, and alerts.

## Technologies Used

- **Machine Learning**: Utilizing algorithms such as supervised learning for predictive maintenance, unsupervised learning for anomaly detection, and reinforcement learning for optimization.

- **Sensor Integration**: Integration of various sensors (e.g., GPS, temperature, pressure) on construction equipment to collect real-time data.

- **IoT (Internet of Things)**: Communication infrastructure to connect sensors and equipment to the central monitoring system.

- **Data Storage and Processing**: Utilizing cloud-based solutions for scalable data storage and processing.

- **Frontend Development**: Development of a web-based dashboard using frameworks like React.js or Angular.js for visualization and interaction with the monitoring system.

- **Backend Development**: Development of server-side logic using technologies like Node.js or Django for data processing, analysis, and model inference.
